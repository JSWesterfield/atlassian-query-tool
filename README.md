ðŸ”ŽðŸ“‡ðŸ“ˆAtlassian Query Tool  is a NodeJS application for fetching data from JIRA to excel

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) to get started with a Slack Slash Command.

```

## Usage

We set up our application by adding the below code:

```javascript

var searchString="project='okrs' and ((createdDate<='2025/11/1' and createdDate>='2025/3/1') or (updatedDate <='2025/11/1' and updatedDate >='2025/3/1')) "
jira.searchJira(searchString).then(function(issue) {
    var fields = ['ISSUE_Number', 'TITLE', 'STATUS'];
    var myISSUE=[];
    for(let i=0; i<issue.total ;i++ ) {
        myISSUE.push(
            {
                "ISSUE_Number":issue.issues[i].key,
                "TITLE": issue.issues[i].fields.status.name,
                "STATUS": issue.issues[i].fields.summary,
            }
        )
    };
    var csv = json2csv({ data: myISSUE});
    fs.writeFile('file.csv', csv, function(err) {
        if (err) throw err;
            console.log('file saved');
        });
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
);

```
